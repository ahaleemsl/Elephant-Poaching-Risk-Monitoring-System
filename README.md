# Elephant Poaching Risk Monitoring System

**This project is to prevent Elephant poaching using an effective ML model that detects the presence of humans near the Wild Elephants**

**There has been an upsurge in poaching and illegal ivory trafficking in recent years across the world. One of the main reasons for this increase is Insufficient anti-poaching      capacity, weak law enforcement, lack of use of effective technologies, and corruption undermine efforts to stop poaching and trafficking in some countries.**

**My project is mainly made for preventing Elephant poaching by monitoring and detecting the presence of human beings in the areas where wild Elephants live and by alerting the wildlife rangers using an alert Multimedia Messaging Service(MMS) along with the detected details. The cameras and other sensors will always monitor the area where the wild Elephants are more found and detect the presence of humans by using effective Machine Learning(ML) models. The given below is the complete functioning flow diagram of this project.**

**Once if humans are detected in the areas near Elephants, an alert message with the captured image and location will be sent to the wildlife rangers' phone**

**Detection of elephants and humans is done with the help of an efficient Machine Learning(ML) model. Machine Learning(ML) model is mainly programmed using the Python programming language and TensorFlow framework.**
